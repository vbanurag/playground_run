'''

You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [a, b] 
indicates that you must take course b first if you want to take course a.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
There are a total of numCourses courses you are required to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.

Return true if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise return false.


Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[0,1]]

Output: true

Explanation: First take course 0 (no prerequisites) and then take course 1.
